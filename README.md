# Plant Leaf Diseases Classification using CNN

## Overview

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify plant leaf diseases. The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of various plant diseases and healthy leaves. The goal is to accurately identify and classify plant diseases, providing a valuable tool for early detection and management.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the PlantVillage dataset, a comprehensive collection of labeled images representing different plant diseases and healthy leaves.
